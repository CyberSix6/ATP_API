given the analyzer Teledyne LeCroy Quantum data M41h 48 gbps for HDMI testing, 
when running the test HDMI 1.4b Compliance source test.  As a user I'm required to check
the required DUT configuration format which matches with the configuration every time, 
having me hitting 'continue' repeatedly during the whole test. I'm sure there's a way to automate
the repeated task of checking the format matching and hitting continue.
